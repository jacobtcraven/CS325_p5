 Caitlin Clark‚Äôs WNBA preseason debut went much like her senior year at Iowa. She hit a bunch of 3s 
 and did so in front of a sold-out crowd.But it didn't end in a win.Just weeks after playing in 
 the NCAA championship game, Clark made her WNBA debut for the Indiana Fever Friday night in a preseason game 
 against the Dallas Wings. She hit three first-quarter 3s and scored a game-high 21 points.But it wasn't enough for 
 the win as All-Star Arike Ogunbowale sunk the Fever with a step-back 3-pointer with 3 seconds remaining in a 
 79-76 Wings win.NOT HER FIRST TIME. WON'T BE HER LAST. https://t.co/SINX2gAt6x pic.twitter.com/D9WCDCIyMi‚Äî Dallas Wings (@DallasWings) May 4, 2024Clark had

 to see. Less then a minute into the game, Clark pulled up from beyond the arc on the right 
 wing for her first 3-point attempt in a WNBA uniform. It sank through the net for a 5-2 Fever

 to extend the Fever lead to 16-9 midway through the first.Her third made 3 with 2:55 left in the

 scored 11 of Indiana‚Äôs 19 points while hitting 3 of 4 3s.When she returned early in the second quarter, 
 she picked up where she left off. This time, she pulled up for a step-back 3 over two-time All-Star

 not an official contest, Clark's streak of 20-point games continues in her WNBA preseason debut. She scored a team-high 
 21 points mostly from a 5-of-13 outing from beyond the arc. She shot 40% overall and was 4-of-5 from 
 the free throw line. The point guard hasn't scored fewer than 20 points in a game since December 2022.The 
 assists (two) didn't come as easy as the 3s and it will take time for the chemistry with Boston 
 (eight points, 4-10 FG) to develop. Clark added three rebounds and two steals, as well as a game-high five 
 turnovers in 28:10 of playing time.This game felt like a regular season contest from start to finish and the 
 atmosphere delivered. It will become tougher once the games pile up against bigger, stronger defenders every other night, but 
 Clark proved any doubters wrong. She'll be fine in the pros and Indiana is going to be a fun 
 team to watch as the season rolls onward.Fri, May 3, 2024 at 9:15 PM CDTCassandra NegleyClark tells four-time WNBA 
 champion Sheryl Swoopes in the post-game interview she thought it was a "good kickoff to the WNBA season" and 
 praised the atmosphere. There's little things she wants to clean up"These are good learning experiences for us," Clark said.

 learn from that."Fri, May 3, 2024 at 9:11 PM CDTCassandra NegleyClark tosses it up on a final shot to

 Clark drives into a clear lane and is denied by Natasha Howard. Clark calls for a foul ‚Äî her

 8:56 PM CDTCassandra NegleyI really like Sides leaving her starters in here in a close game, even though it's 
 a preseason opener. WNBA training camp is such a small window and the Fever's opening schedule is TOUGH (Connecticut, 
 New York, Seattle, Las Vegas). Put them in the situation now when it doesn't matter in the standings and

 Fever starter out there is NaLyssa Smith. We'll see if she sees any more time tonight, or if Sides 
 decides to see how players further down the depth chart handle a close game in the fourth quarter. Indiana 
 lost 16 games by single digits last year, a growing pain given the youth on the team.Fri, May 3, 
 2024 at 8:31 PM CDTCassandra NegleySuch a pretty pull-up by Jaelyn Brown for her seventh bucket of the game. 
 She's up to a game-high 17 points for Dallas and looks like a confident, comfortable vet out there. If 
 Brown doesn't make the Wings roster, she'll likely land on some hardship contracts throughout the season to fill in 
 for seven-day and 10-day stints.Fri, May 3, 2024 at 8:21 PM CDTYahoo Sports StaffClark heads to the bench after

 turnovers piled up and it will be a focus for improvement throughout the season against better defenders than she 
 faced in college.Fri, May 3, 2024 at 8:14 PM CDTCassandra Negley"Catch, shoot, from DFW."Everyone prepped their deep-distance location calls,

 second half ...Fri, May 3, 2024 at 8:01 PM CDTCassandra NegleyFever at the halfIt will be interesting to see 
 how much playing time Clark receives in the second half. The Fever have 15 players in camp and need 
 to cut three before the season opener on May 14. There's one more preseason game on the schedule next 
 week at home. Head coach Christie Sides will probably want to see more from those players in the mix 
 for final roster spots.The trio of NaLyssa Smith (16:31), Aliyah Boston (17:33) and Clark (16:05) each played at least 
 five minutes more than any other Fever players in the first half. All are locks for the team and 
 starting positions. Kelsey Mitchell (out, left ankle) and Katie Lou Samuelson (out, right ankle and coming back from maternity 
 leave) will fill out the projected starting lineup when they're back.Fri, May 3, 2024 at 7:54 PM CDTYahoo Sports

 scoring as its main offense. That changed last year with Natasha Howard in the mix and fully healthy season 
 from Satou Sabally. Jacy Sheldon showing early she can be a great offensive addition to the team as a

 the WNBA than this one with ready-made household names entering a league that has struggled for much of its 
 existence to build them. The only thing comparable would be its launch in 1997 with Olympic superstars. The task 
 now is to keep the audience developed in the collegiate ranks as upward of 24 million watched Clark, the

 (AP Photo/Michael Conroy)Caitlin Clark is accustomed to dropping 30-pieces and breaking scoring records. Her own point totals are not 
 what has her excited about officially joining the Indiana Fever as the No. 1 overall pick in the 2024 
 WNBA Draft.It‚Äôs the ones to come from Aliyah Boston, the Fever‚Äôs 2023 No. 1 overall pick whom Clark called 
 ‚Äúone of the best post players in the entire world.‚Äù‚ÄúMy point guard eyes just light up at that,‚Äù Clark 
 said Monday night at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.The general consensus from analysts, league evaluators and Clark herself is 
 that the NCAA‚Äôs all-time leading scorer‚Äôs passing ability is what will quickly translate to the professional level. Boston, an 
 analyst covering Iowa for the Big Ten Network this season, told a group of reporters the same hours before 
 the draft.‚ÄúEveryone talks about her shots and, obviously, not everyone can shoot from the logo,‚Äù the league‚Äôs reigning Rookie of the Year said. ‚ÄúBut I think for me [it‚Äôs] her ability, one, to run the floor ‚Ä¶ but also to be able to make those passes to teammates [and] to find an open player.‚ÄùIt‚Äôs welcome news for the Fever after ranking 11th out of 12 teams in assists per game last season despite Boston dominating the paint and Kelsey Mitchell, one of the NCAA‚Äôs best scorers, lighting up the scoreboard.
