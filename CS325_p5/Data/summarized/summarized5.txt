Spencer Dinwiddie signed with the Lakers for a chance to win and activate a $1 bonus if they secure the 18th title. The bonus dates back to a humorous gesture in a previous contract. Dinwiddie, known for unconventional ideas, previously tried to pay the Wizards $12 million for a cryptocurrency patch on jerseys.
